## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### For deploy.cx:

1. **Push to GitHub** ✅ (Already done)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect Repository to deploy.cx**
   - Link GitHub repository: ShayNeeo/ping0
   - Select branch: `main`
   - Auto-detect Dockerfile

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   PORT=8080
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   BASE_URL=https://0.id.vn
   RUST_LOG=info
   ```

4. **Configure Persistent Storage**
   - Mount path: `/app/uploads`
   - Size: 10GB (adjust as needed)
   - Enable backups: Yes

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for build
   - Monitor logs

6. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://0.id.vn/health
   
   # Test upload
   curl -X POST https://0.id.vn/upload -F "file=@test.jpg"
   
   # Test QR generation
   curl -X POST https://0.id.vn/link -d "link=https://example.com"
   ```

## 🔍 TESTING LOCALLY (Without Docker/Cargo Installed)

Since you don't have Docker or Cargo locally, testing must be done on deploy.cx:

1. **Push changes to GitHub**
2. **Deploy to deploy.cx staging environment** (if available)
3. **Test on deploy.cx preview URL**
4. **Promote to production**

Alternative: Use GitHub Codespaces (has Docker pre-installed)

## 📈 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Minimum:
- **CPU**: 0.5 cores
- **Memory**: 512MB
- **Disk**: 5GB (OS + app)
- **Storage**: 10GB (uploads volume)

### Recommended:
- **CPU**: 1 core
- **Memory**: 1GB
- **Disk**: 5GB (OS + app)
- **Storage**: 20GB (uploads volume with room to grow)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **File Retention**: No automatic cleanup of old uploads
   - **Mitigation**: Set up manual cleanup or backup rotation
   - **Future**: Add TTL/expiration feature

2. **No Authentication**: Anyone can upload files
   - **Impact**: Potential for abuse
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting (deploy.cx feature)
   - **Future**: Add optional API key authentication

3. **No Image Compression**: Large images stored as-is
   - **Impact**: Storage usage
   - **Future**: Add automatic image optimization

4. **Single Region**: No geographic distribution
   - **Mitigation**: Use CDN for static assets
   - **Future**: Multi-region deployment

## 📝 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### Required:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://0.id.vn  # Your production domain
```

### Optional (with defaults):
```bash
PORT=8080                  # Server port
HOST=0.0.0.0              # Bind address
RUST_LOG=info             # Log level (error, warn, info, debug, trace)
```

---

## 🔄 MAINTENANCE

### Regular Tasks:
- **Weekly**: Check logs for errors
- **Monthly**: Review disk usage, update dependencies
- **Quarterly**: Security audit, performance review

### Monitoring:
- Health endpoint: `https://0.id.vn/health`
- Expected response: `{"status":"healthy","service":"ping0"}`
- Monitor: Response time, error rate, disk usage

   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready: security, monitoring, and deployment config"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to deploy.cx** (Follow DEPLOYMENT.md)

3. **Configure DNS** (Point 0.id.vn to deploy.cx)

4. **Set up Monitoring** (Use deploy.cx dashboard)

5. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Upload various file types
   - Generate QR codes
   - Check health endpoint
